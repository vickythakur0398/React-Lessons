//s1 here i have created a function i.e a component and it is a practice to sraert with Caps 
// bcs when we will import it into main js than we can make it tags like <h1></h1> simmilarly like <ExpenseItem>
// </ExpenseItem> so page will know it is not html tags as it is not starting with small case

function ExpenseItem()
{
        return <h2>Expense Item</h2>
}


export default ExpenseItem;
